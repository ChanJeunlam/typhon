Current changes
===============

- Fixed writing of zipped XML files.
  When using typhon.arts.xml.save() appending the '.gz' extension to the
  filename now leads to properly zipped files.

- Moved typhon.cm to typhon.plots.cm.
  It is imported automatically when performing

  ```python
  import typhon.plots
  ```

- Adjusted the yellow color in the two qualitative colormaps. They now offer
  more contrast on white background.
